Hi! My name is Andres (a.k.a **Dede**) and I'm a research engineer in AI and HPC. 
Welcome to my tiny, legally purchased part of the internet where I mainly post 
ramblings about topics that interest me. 

My stuff is organized in a more regular TIL ("today I learned") where I write small posts about 
new things I have learned. This is mostly meant for me, but if it helps someone else, great!

The other part is my blog, where I will try to go more in depth about some advanced/technical topics,
albeit with less frequency.

My main interests are in AI, HPC, Nix, Python, and Rust, but since this is my 
"dung pile of thoughts", anything is fair game! 

Hope you enjoy :)
