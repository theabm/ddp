Welcome to my tiny, legally purchased part of the internet where I mainly post ramblings about topics that interest me.\nMy stuff is organized in a more regular TIL (\u0026ldquo;today I learned\u0026rdquo;) where I write small posts about new things I have learned. This is mostly meant for me, but if it helps someone else, great!\nThe other part is my blog, where I will try to go more in depth about some advanced/technical topics, albeit with less frequency.\nMy main interests are in AI, HPC, Nix, Python, and Rust, but since this is my \u0026ldquo;dung pile of thoughts\u0026rdquo;, anything is fair game!\nHope you enjoy :)\n","date":"22 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"HomePage","summary":"","title":"HomePage","type":"page"},{"content":"Welcome to my Blog section where I dive into more advanced/technical topics. These are things that took me some time to figure out and that are not so well documented in other places.\nIn general, I try to not repeat other content you can find around the internet and actually contribute something new.\nI also post about some of my side projects here :)\n","date":"22 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Blog","type":"posts"},{"content":"Welcome to my TIL section where I try to post about new things I have learned.
